What is doppyo?
===============

doppyo is a diagnostics/verification package for climate forecast systems. It is still in the early stages of development

Three modules are currently available:

1. ``skill`` : functions for assessing one data set relative to another, usually model output(s) relative to observations or reanalyses
2. ``diagnostic`` : functions for computing various atmospheric and oceanic diagnostics
3. ``utils`` : general support and utility functions for the doppyo package
