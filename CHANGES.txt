		Made skill.rank_histogram() parallelizable
		Replaced appropriate usages of utils.calc_gradient() with new xr.differentiate(). Renamed

			dimensional coordinates
		Fixed bug in utils.xy_from_latlon()
		Added utils.add() and utils.multiply() functions
		Restructured utils.leadtime_to_datetime() and datetime_to_leadtime() to be simpler but only 
			deal with times that have frequencies that can be determined from pandas.infer_freq()
		Moved utils.bias_correction functions, skill.did_event(), skill.likelihood(), 
			diagnostic.atmos_energy_cycle with loop_triple_terms to sugar
		Added nan-catch to utils.histogram()
		Added utils._equal_coords() for checking whether the coordinates of two xarray objects are equal
		Added utils.get_time_name() and removed hardcoded references to time dimension
