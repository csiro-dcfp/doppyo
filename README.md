========

doppyo is a diagnostics/verification package for climate forecast systems. It is still in the very early stages of development.

Current functionality
======================

Three modules are currently available

1. ``skill`` : functions for assessing one data set relative to another (usually model output relative to observation).

2. ``diagnostic`` : functions for computing various atmospheric and oceanic diagnostics.

3. ``utils`` : general support functions for the doppyo package.
